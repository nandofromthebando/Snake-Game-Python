2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
3. Try to eat the `$` (food) to increase your score.
4. Don't let the snake hit the walls or run into itself, or the game will end.
5. Press the `ESC` key to exit the game.

## Controls

- Arrow Down: Move the snake down.
- Arrow Left: Move the snake left.
- Arrow Right: Move the snake right.

## Gameplay

- Your score is displayed at the top of the screen.
